SOAP::Clean version 0.02
========================

		    *** THIS IS AN ALPHA RELEASE ***
			*** USE WITH CAUTION ***

SOAP::Clean is a set of modules for quickly and simply deploying SOAP
client and servers. On the server-side, it is intended to enable legacy,
command-line oriented applications to be made into Web Services with
little or no modification. On the client-side, it is intended to make
Web Services look like legacy, command-line oriented applications!

SOAP::Clean was original developed to provide a framework for
computational scientists to use one another's components, without having
to download and compile each others codes. The name SOAP::Clean comes
from the fact that it is designed for entire XML documents and non-XML
files to be embedded within SOAP requests and responses without losing
their integrety. These files are passed directly to the legacy
application on the server and stored directly to disk on the client.

SOAP::Clean is _not_ intended for implementing "servlets". In
particular, it makes absolutely no attempt to map XML data types into
convenient Perl datatypes. Nor does it allow arbitrary Perl functions on
the server to be invoked by SOAP requests. If need this functionality, I
recommend SOAP::Lite.

You can download the latest release for SOAP::Clean from CPAN or,

Support 
======= 
We wish to acknowledge that the development of this software was/is
supported by the following National Science Foundation (NSF) under the
following awards,
 
ACIR-0085969 - Adaptive Software for Field-driven Simulations
EIA-9972853 - A Two-tier Computation and Visualization Facility for
	Multiscale Problems

Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in
this publication are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily
reflect the views of the National Science Foundation.

DEPENDENCIES
============
This module requires these other modules and libraries:

    Perl 5.6.x or better
    XML::LibXML (or XML::Twig 3.10 or better)
    LWP::Version
    libxml2 from http://xmlsoft.org/

INSTALLATION
============
To install this module type the following (probably as root):

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you are not root, you might try changing the first command to something
like,

   perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/usr/share LIB=~/usr/share/lib/perl5


Configuring your web server
===========================

Then the first thing that has to be done is for your administrative
people to set up a directory into which you can put CGI scripts. You
will need write access to this directory so that you can update the
scripts as we make changes.

Yes, I know - this is a huge security hole. 

Once this is done, save the following script into this directory as
"printenv".

#!/usr/bin/env perl
##
##  printenv -- demo CGI program which just prints its environment
##

print "Content-type: text/plain\n\n";
foreach $var (sort(keys(%ENV))) {
    $val = $ENV{$var};
    $val =~ s|\n|\\n|g;
    $val =~ s|"|\\"|g;
    print "${var}=\"${val}\"\n";
}

Make sure that the "printenv" script has world read and execute
permission.

Now try accessing this script from a web browser with the appropriate
URL. NOTE: When you access the script, you should see the results of
running the script, not the Perl code for the script!

Once this is working, then you can proceed to installing SOAP::Clean.

Running the sample client and server
====================================

soap-client.pl contains a sample client. soap-server.cgi contains a
sample server. These are configured to run without going through the web
server. This is a quick check that you have installed the external Perl
libraries and SOAP::Clean correctly.

To run the client, which invokes the server, use,

    % cd examples
    % perl soap-client.pl

If you get errors from Perl that it can't find some libraries, make sure
that you have set the PERL5LIB environment variable correctly.

Running the test client and server
==================================

Copy the files "test.cgi" and "test.sh", which are attached to this
message, into your CGI directory and make sure that their permissions
are set correctly.

If you install any of the external Perl library in a non-standard
location (ie, if you have PERL5LIB in order to get the sample scripts to
work), then you will have to add,

    use lib '/where/you/installed/the/perl/libs';

or whatever to test.cgi, before the line 'use SOAP::Clean::CGI;'.

Go back to the SOAP-Clean directory and try the following,

    % cd examples
    % ./wsdl-usage.pl http://.../test.cgi?wsdl
    % ./wsdl-invoke.pl http://.../test.cgi?wsdl Call x=1 y=2

Congratulations! You've installed and run your first web service!

Writing web services
====================

Once this is working, then you are ready to write your own web services.
Unfortunately, I haven't written the documentation for that yet.
